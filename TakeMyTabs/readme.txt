This Android project demonstrates a Tab Layout which can be used for Lateral Navigation.
It uses a v7 toolbar instead of the standard App Bar, a TabLayout and a ViewPager which serves as the Layout Manager.
A PagerAdapter class which derives from FragmentStatePagerAdapter provides the data to be displayed on each of the fragments.
Remember to create a PageChange listener and a Tab Selected listener which do the job of displaying the correct tab when paging
